git push -u origin main

Network Architecture & Global Access:
====================================
‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This system requires INTERNET-ACCESSIBLE server deployment

Current Configuration:
- Default server URL: calls.popzplace.com:3001 (DMZ deployment)
- Mobile app connects to server via internet from anywhere
- Twilio webhooks require public internet access for call processing

Deployment Options for Global Access:

1. DMZ ZONE DEPLOYMENT (Current Setup):
   - Place server in router DMZ zone (192.168.68.69)
   - Configure port forwarding: External 80/443 ‚Üí Internal 3001
   - Use domain name: calls.popzplace.com
   - SSL certificates required for HTTPS
   - Cost: ~$15-40/year (domain + dynamic DNS)

2. COMMERCIAL VPS DEPLOYMENT:
   - Deploy to AWS, DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.
   - Server accessible from any internet connection
   - Built-in public IP and SSL support
   - Professional hosting environment
   - Cost: ~$5-20/month + domain

3. SELF-HOSTED WITH TUNNEL:
   - Use ngrok, Cloudflare Tunnel, or similar
   - Temporary solution for development/testing
   - Not recommended for production use

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GLOBAL ACCESS:
- Public internet IP address or domain name
- HTTPS/SSL certificates (required by Twilio webhooks)
- Port 3001 accessible from internet
- Mobile app configured with public server URL

Without DMZ/VPS deployment, system only works on LOCAL NETWORK!

Security Notes:
===============
- All sensitive data removed (.env, .db files, SSL certificates)
- API keys and credentials excluded via .gitignore
- Example configuration files provided for setup
- Personal access token used for GitHub authentication
- HTTPS required for production deployment with Twilio
- Firewall configuration recommended for DMZ deployment
